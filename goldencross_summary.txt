For this algorithm, we utilize the moving 200 day average and the moving 50 day average. When the 200 day average intersects the 50 day average and the 50 day average is larger after the intersection, this is called a golden cross. A golden cross is an indication to buy. When the same intersection happens but the 50 day average is smaller after the intersection, this is called a death cross. A death cross is an indication to sell.
