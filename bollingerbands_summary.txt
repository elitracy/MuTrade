For this algorithm we utilize the moving average and standard deviation over the past 20 days. Adding two moving standard deviations to the moving average gives us the top bollinger band and subtracting two moving standard deviations from the moving average gives us the bottom bollinger band. When the price intersects the bottom bollinger band, it is an indicator to buy, and when the price intersects the top bollinger band, it is an indicator to sell.
